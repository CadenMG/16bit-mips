# Write a subroutine in your assembly language to output
# a sequence of characters (i.e., a string) stored in memory on the
# output device.  This subroutine should call the subroutine in part
# 2 above in order to output each character.  You should determine
# how you will be representing strings in your architecture.  For
# example, the string could be either null-terminated or its length
# could be specified.
